Lab Assignment 04

In this assignment, we analyzed course code choices of 100 students to count inversions, revealing their preferences. We also implemented integer multiplication for large numbers using both standard and divide-and-conquer methods, highlighting the importance of algorithm efficiency. Overall, we also enhanced our understanding of version control with GitHub.
